# Number Guessing Game (OOP Version)

This Python program implements a number guessing game using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The game generates a random number within a specified range, and the player's goal is to guess the correct number. After each guess, the game provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low. The game continues until the player guesses the correct number. At the end of each game, the user is given the option to play again or exit.
